## Section B: Domain Speciality

Given the programming language choices in the other sections and the limitations on the choice in Section B I was only left with the option of using Java in order to meet the specific requirements for Section B. Java is not my language of choice.  While I have previously developed a Geocoding Android/ASP.NET application that encompassed all of the requirements for web development and data CRUD functionality via API JSON, it was all programmed using C#. I can request permission to share that code with you if that suits your requirements. After doing some research and making several attempts I realized that I do not have the resources within 10 days in order to replicate my prior accomplishments using Java. 

As a former project manager when I encountered a situation of this nature I would take the following actions. (1) Arrange a meeting with stakeholders and the development team. (2) At the meeting explain the resource constraints. (3) Provide alternatives as a way to resolve the resource constraint. (4) Ask the stakeholders to clarify their priorities so as to better focus the efforts of the development team. (5) Collaborate with stakeholders and the development team to meet the primary goals by including out-of-the-box alternative solutions. (6) Reach an agreement on how to proceed.

As a Cogrammer faced with a programmer that I am mentoring in this situation I would explain to them the steps above and request that they either take those actions themselves or get in touch with their project manager to take those steps on their behalf. 

As the programmer in this situation I would appreciate the opportunity to take the above steps with the hiring team to ensure that your goals for my completion of this exercise will be met. 

I am confident in my knowledge and abilities to accomplish the tasks in this exercise as this is something that I have done on prior projects using other languages with longer timelines. Though I am unable to meet the requirements as currently specified, I feel that I am a good candidate for the code review and mentoring position, and look forward to working with you to ensure you are able to accurately evaluate my suitability.
